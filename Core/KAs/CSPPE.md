# Cloud Security, Privacy, Policy and Ethics - CSPPE
Students will be able to define security governance policies, and
principles / risk management compliance related needs and issues.
Students will describe how the human component and access management is an important part of cloud security management. Students should demonstrate understanding by implementing best
practices in security operations, security engineering, use of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad, and assessment
and testing in threat evaluation and mitigation.

Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.
