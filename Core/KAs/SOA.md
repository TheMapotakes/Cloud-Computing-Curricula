# Service oriented architecture - SOA

This area recognized how the cloud impacts the traditional framework of SOA. Micro-services are replacing monolithic deployments.
This is changing performance metrics of SLAs, as well as Service
Level Objectives (SLOs).

Students should be able to outline an infrastructure in sufficient
detail for technical/infrastructure architecture using SOA principles
and practices, as well as demonstrate an understanding of SMART
goals and business requirements. Students should also demonstrate
the ability to identity risks relating to functional and non-functional
requirements. Additionally, students should be able to develop a
suitable business architecture, building blocks, models and views
clearly demonstrating the ability to be able to design or redesign a
solution to meet necessary services level requirements.

Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.

## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [SOA-CL1](LOs/SOA-CL1.md):  	Using the architectural process framework, identify the various inputs, stakeholders, statements of requirements and constraints that guide an architect as to the nature and shape of solutions to be built. 	 
* [SOA-CL2](LOs/SOA-CL2.md):  	Recognize the difference between functional and non-functional requirements. 	 
* [SOA-CL3](LOs/SOA-CL3.md):  	Recognize ways to describe the data structures used by a business and/or its applications, including metadata: that is, descriptions of data in storage, data in motion, data structures and data items.	 
* [SOA-CL4](LOs/SOA-CL4.md):  	Demonstrate how to describe data in storage using data models.	 
* [SOA-CL5](LOs/SOA-CL5.md):  	Recognize how the three primary data qualities (CIA) may be measured at three or more levels. 	 
* [SOA-CL6](LOs/SOA-CL6.md):  	Explain ways to modularize the internal structure of an application, and ways to connect components, ranging from tightly coupled to loosely-coupled. 	 
* [SOA-CL7](LOs/SOA-CL7.md):  	Critique common OO design patterns. 	 
* [SOA-CL8](LOs/SOA-CL8.md):  	Explain the goals and concepts of application portfolio management.	 

## Experiental Learning Objectives

* [SOA-EL1](LOs/SOA-EL1.md):  	Demonstrate the concepts of an Application Programming Interface (API) and Interface Description Language (IDL).	 
* [SOA-EL2](LOs/SOA-EL2.md):  	Demonstrate ways to describe the structure and behaviour of a business system (not necessarily related to computers), covering business functions or capabilities, business processes and the roles of the actors involved.	 
* [SOA-EL3](LOs/SOA-EL3.md):  	Demonstrate business process decomposition and automation, including how to map business functions, processes, goals and services to the applications they support.	 
* [SOA-EL4](LOs/SOA-EL4.md):  	Demonstrate the basic units of cloud computer networks: computer, processor, operating system, networking and storage.	 
* [SOA-EL5](LOs/SOA-EL5.md):  	Design a cloud service solution that is fault tolerant and meets the minimum SLA requirements.
