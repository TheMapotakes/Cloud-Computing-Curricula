# Storage Resources on the Cloud - SRC
In this KA, students will understand, appreciate and gain insight
into the differences between different types and schema of data.
Students will compare and utilize different cloud storage types,
whether block or object storage, and determine their suitability
for a given scenario. Students will understand and compare the
functionality and affordances of file systems and distributed file
systems. Students will collect, store, extract, query and analyze data
in files, relational databases (SQL), NoSQL databases, as well as
Data Warehouses.

Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.

## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [SRC-CL1](LOs/SRC-CL1.md):  	Describe data types (as in text, audio, images, video, etc.).	 
* [SRC-CL2](LOs/SRC-CL2.md):  	List the differences between structured and unstructured data. Give examples of each type of data.	 
* [SRC-CL3](LOs/SRC-CL3.md):  	Given a scenario using storage, determine whether the storage abstraction should be structured or unstructured and give reasons for this decision. Decide on an appropriate cloud based storage solution.	 
* [SRC-CL4](LOs/SRC-CL4.md):  	Describe the difference between static and dynamic/streaming data and the implications this has on cloud data storage selection.	 
* [SRC-CL5](LOs/SRC-CL5.md):  	Describe the motivation, advantages and disadvantages of adopting software defined storage (SDS).	 
* [SRC-CL6](LOs/SRC-CL6.md):  	Recognize the issues in storing state outside of a database in a cache.	 
* [SRC-CL7](LOs/SRC-CL7.md):  	Discuss the concepts of cloud object storage as well as their programming interfaces.	 
* [SRC-CL8](LOs/SRC-CL8.md):  	Explain and compare the advantages and disadvantages of flat files, SQL databases, and NoSQL database solutions.	 
* [SRC-CL9](LOs/SRC-CL9.md):  	Illustrate the abstractions offered by file systems and distributed file systems. Compare and contrast different types of file systems.	 
* [SRC-CL10](LOs/SRC-CL10.md):  	Enumerate and define the characteristics of different storage types and describe the differences between them. For a given scenario, determine the best storage type and give the reasons for this decision.	 
* [SRC-CL11](LOs/SRC-CL11.md):  	Discuss big data managed services in the cloud.	 
* [SRC-CL12](LOs/SRC-CL12.md):  	Discuss using Cloud managed services to run Spark, Hive, Pig, and MapReduce in the cloud.	 
* [SRC-CL13](LOs/SRC-CL13.md):  	Discuss building ETL pipelines as a managed cloud services.	 

## Experiental Learning Objectives

* [SRC-EL1](LOs/SRC-EL1.md):  	Create, populate, access, and manipulate cloud data storage suitable for storing structured data.	 
* [SRC-EL2](LOs/SRC-EL2.md):  	Create, populate, access, and manipulate cloud data storage suitable for storing unstructured data.	 
* [SRC-EL3](LOs/SRC-EL3.md):  	Manipulate the sharing and privacy settings for an existing data stored on the cloud.	 
* [SRC-EL4](LOs/SRC-EL4.md):  	Discuss the techniques and costs to migrate data from and to the cloud. Practice moving a large data set to and from the cloud or across different cloud service providers.	 
* [SRC-EL5](LOs/SRC-EL5.md):  	Consolidate heterogeneous data types and schema into a single schema.	 
* [SRC-EL6](LOs/SRC-EL6.md):  	Compare and contrast different types of databases and discuss their design trade-offs.	 
* [SRC-EL7](LOs/SRC-EL7.md):  	Practice the basics of SQL language to gather insights from relational databases.	 
* [SRC-EL8](LOs/SRC-EL8.md):  	Implement a prototype of a key-value store supporting different data structures.	 
* [SRC-EL9](LOs/SRC-EL9.md):  	Configure, deploy and utilize a NoSQL database solution in a web service.	 
* [SRC-EL10](LOs/SRC-EL10.md):  	Build and execute analytics queries against a large data set in a data warehouse.
