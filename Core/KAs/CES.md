# Cloud Elasticity and Scalability - CES
Students should be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of cloud PaaS and IaaS vertical and horizontal scaling
configurations, with associated cost/performance trade-offs. Additionally, students should be able to implement a cloud service
with scaling and load balancing configured for a given application
deployment scenario. Consideration should also be given to geographical/regional scaling attributes of the deployed cloud service,
with a rationale presented on configuration choices.

Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.

## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [CES-CL1](LOs/CES-CL1.md):  	Discuss and critique the cost/performance characteristics and trade-offs of using scalable cloud services.	 
* [CES-CL2](LOs/CES-CL2.md):  	Describe the vertical and horizontal scaling approaches that can be deployed to enhance the performance of a cloud service.	 
* [CES-CL3](LOs/CES-CL3.md):  	Explain the definition and purpose of scaling.	 
* [CES-CL4](LOs/CES-CL4.md):  	Describe common load patterns and how they affect the approach to scalability.	 
* [CES-CL5](LOs/CES-CL5.md):  	Enumerate the strategies and considerations in scaling cloud applications.	 
* [CES-CL6](LOs/CES-CL6.md):  	Discuss the advantages of auto-scaling and the mechanisms used to achieve it.	 
* [CES-CL7](LOs/CES-CL7.md):  	Describe the importance of load balancing in cloud applications and enumerate various methods to achieve it.	 
* [CES-CL8](LOs/CES-CL8.md):  	List the primary benefits of serverless computing and explain the concept of serverless functions.	 
* [CES-CL9](LOs/CES-CL9.md):  	Describe cloud performance models and discuss common design patterns for Cloud applications and systems.
