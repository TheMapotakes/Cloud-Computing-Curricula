# Cloud-based Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - CAIML

Simply stated, a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) solution
is about providing relevant infrastructure and machines that can
perform tasks that are characteristic of human intelligence. The
massive data storage and compute ability provided by the cloud has
increased the ability to perform machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL). While AI encompasses a wide range of approaches
and solutions about mimicking human intelligence, ML is a way
of achieving AI, by relying on (cloud-based) machines, and related
data sources. DL is one of the many approaches to ML, that mimics the biological structure of the brain, and involves using novel
techniques, such as artificial neural networks in combination with
utilizing large data sets.

In this KA, students should be able to observe, identify, and explain core cloud mechanisms that help build relevant AI solutions.
They should also explain the difference between using cloud-hosted
AI/ML solutions that many cloud providers offer, and working on a
do-it-yourself solution that utilizes existing core resources (compute, storage, network, etc.) on the cloud infrastructure. Students -
based on their understanding level and focus on the subject matter
- should be able to outline a plethora of relevant ML/AI tools and
methodologies, and narrow it down to pick a relevant experimental
methodology necessary to perform statistical analysis of large-scale
data sources.
