# Computing Abstractions on the Cloud - CAC

In this KA students will explore different encapsulation mechanisms
to abstract computing resources on the cloud. They will compare the
capabilities, limitations and overhead of utilizing virtual machines,
containers and container clusters, as well as serverless offerings.  
Further, students will experiment with and understand the potential
advantages and cost of utilizing specialized hardware offerings on
the cloud such as GPUs, FPGAs and TPUs.

## Learning Objectives

### Virtualization
* Discuss compute, network and storage virtualization and
outline their role in enabling the cloud computing system
model. Identify reasons why virtualization is useful, especially on the cloud.
* Utilize virtualization to deploy virtual machines on cloud
resources

### Containers
* Describe how containers achieve lightweight virtualization.
* Describe the advantages and disadvantages of containers
compared to virtual machines.
* Build, deploy, manage, and administer containers and container clusters and architect containerized applications using
container registries.

### FaaS
* Describe the rationale behind serverless computing and how
it enables the running and scaling of applications without
the need to manage servers.
* Develop and deploy a service utilizing FaaS using APIs that
are provided as an auto-scaling service.
* Given a scenario with a set of requirements, determine the
best computation type and give the reasons for this decision.

### Specialized Computer Resources
* Describe the advantages of specialized hardware such as
GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs.
* Evaluate application requirements to decide on a suitable
specialized hardware resource.
* Deploy an application or service which utilizes specialized
hardware resources.
