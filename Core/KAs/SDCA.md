# Software Development using Cloud APIs - SDCA

Implementation of a cloud-enabled system requires the ability to
integrate third-party application programming interfaces (APIs)
offered by the providers of cloud computing services. Common
implementation practices include cloud service integration at different levels. Service-level (Platform-as-a-Service) APIs provide
access to, and functionality of, a cloud environment allowing the
application to integrate with such systems as messaging, database,
and data storage. Application-level (Software-as-a-Service) APIs
connect the application with the cloud-enabled IT infrastructure
that could provide access to such applications as email and collaboration, customer relationship management, etc. Infrastructure-level
(Infrastructure-as-a-Service) APIs help control cloud resources, as
well as their distribution.
Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.

## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [SDCA-CL1](LOs/SDCA-CL1.md):  	Define common implementation practices for cloud-based software development. 	 
* [SDCA-CL2](LOs/SDCA-CL2.md):  	Analyze the impact on the application/service performance and dependability resulting from migrating it to the cloud. 	 
* [SDCA-CL3](LOs/SDCA-CL3.md):  	Assess the factors influencing the performance, reliability, and availability of the implemented cloud-based application/service.	 
* [SDCA-CL4](LOs/SDCA-CL4.md):  	Explain the impact of using cloud computing solutions on an application/service.	 
* [SDCA-CL5](LOs/SDCA-CL5.md):  	Describe the key features, practices, and architecture of cloudâ€“native application development.	 
* [SDCA-CL6](LOs/SDCA-CL6.md):  	Discuss the cloud async methods for publish-subscribe pattern which are  used within managed cloud messaging services.	 
* [SDCA-CL7](LOs/SDCA-CL7.md):  	Discuss the Cloud based large scale data storage scenarios including  Data Lake and Data Warehouse.	 

## Experiental Learning Objectives

* [SDCA-EL1](LOs/SDCA-EL1.md):  	Demonstrate the ability to apply commonly-accepted implementation practices.	 
* [SDCA-EL2](LOs/SDCA-EL2.md):  	Build a cloud-based application/service and experiment with it under different conditions affecting its performance, reliability, and availability.
