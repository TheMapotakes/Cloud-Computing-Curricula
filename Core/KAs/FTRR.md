# Fault Tolerance, Resilience and Reliability - FTRR

Reliability is one desired property of any cloud-based solution, and
can be summarized as providing resources, bandwidth, and relevant
interfaces that perform consistently well, to maintain a high-level
of service availability, under dynamic conditions of the cloud. To
provide reliability, many cloud systems take advantage of an eclectic
resource-base and relevant tools that (i) can take resilient actions
autonomously to adapt to changing conditions on the cloud, and (ii)
can provide advanced fault tolerant mechanisms that can handle
failures.

Students should be able to understand the concepts of resource
dynamism and autonomy, and how the cloud is designed to take advantage of eclectic resource state to achieve high availability. They
should also acquire a basic understanding of how fault tolerance
can be ensured based on high availability. Additional topics include:
high availability, points of failures, service uptime and impact of
cloud-imposed delays, and disaster recovery.

Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.

## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [FTTR-CL1](LOs/FTTR-CL1.md):  	Identify and list cloud tools to provide high availability (HA).	 
* [FTTR-CL2](LOs/FTTR-CL2.md):  	Understand load balancing mechanisms on the middleware.	 
* [FTTR-CL3](LOs/FTTR-CL3.md):  	Define the concept of service availability, and classify different levels of availability.	 
* [FTTR-CL4](LOs/FTTR-CL4.md):  	Explain the difference between HA and resiliancy/scalability/fault tolerance.	 
* [FTTR-CL5](LOs/FTTR-CL5.md):  	Describe and critique cloud-based fault tolerance technologies.	 
* [FTTR-CL6](LOs/FTTR-CL6.md):  	Understand the concept of service-level agreements (SLAs), and related requirements.	 
* [FTTR-CL7](LOs/FTTR-CL7.md):  	Define SLAs and SLOs and describe their importance in Cloud Computing.	 
* [FTTR-CL8](LOs/FTTR-CL8.md):  	Describe the importance of business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR).	 
* [FTTR-CL9](LOs/FTTR-CL9.md):  	Describe the two solutions provided by a cloud service provider the BCDR strategy.	 

## Experiental Learning Objectives

* [FTTR-EL1](LOs/FTTR-EL1.md):  	Configure and deploy a fault tolerant cloud service solution that meets the minimum SLA requirements.	 
* [FTTR-EL2](LOs/FTTR-EL2.md):  	Set up backup on a VM, configure a backup policy, restore from backup using a cloud service.	 
* [FTTR-EL3](LOs/FTTR-EL3.md):  	Experiment and compare and apply failover and failback operations.	 
* [FTTR-EL4](LOs/FTTR-EL4.md):  	Configure, test, and trigger the failover to the secondary region with a cloud recovery service.	 
* [FTTR-EL5](LOs/FTTR-EL5.md):  	Experiment with a cloud service to deploy a geo-replicated web service.
