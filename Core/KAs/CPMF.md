# Cloud Programming Models and Frameworks - CPMF

In this KA, students will explore the various capabilities of cloudbased programming models and frameworks. Students will understand the benefits and limitations of each so that they can assess
applicability based on the problem domain. Students will gain working experience in one or more of these programming models.

Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.

## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [CPMF-CL1](LOs/CPMF-CL1.md):  	Explain how to describe data in motion, data flow definitions, regular expressions, message formats and canonical data models. 	 
* [CPMF-CL2](LOs/CPMF-CL2.md):  	Describe the aspects of, and the differences between, different programming models.	 
* [CPMF-CL3](LOs/CPMF-CL3.md):  	Discuss the execution flow, scheduling and fault tolerance concepts in various programming models. 	 
* [CPMF-CL4](LOs/CPMF-CL4.md):  	Recall and contrast different popular cloud programming models. 	 
* [CPMF-CL5](LOs/CPMF-CL5.md):  	Discuss the features and advantages of various parallel and distributed programming models. 	 
* [CPMF-CL6](LOs/CPMF-CL6.md):  	Differentiate between interactive (non-batch), batch, and stream processing models and their applicability to different problem domains.	 

## Experiental Learning Objectives

* [CPMF-EL1](LOs/CPMF-EL1.md):  	Illustrate and explain the execution workflow, overhead, fault tolerance and logical flow of a cloud-based programming framework. 	 
* [CPMF-EL2](LOs/CPMF-EL2.md):  	Design and implement a solution to pre-process a large text-based dataset for data cleaning purposes using a cloud-based programming framework.	 
* [CPMF-EL3](LOs/CPMF-EL3.md):  	Implement an application using a cloud-based programming framework. 	 
* [CPMF-EL4](LOs/CPMF-EL4.md):  	Investigate the possible sources of different bug types in cloud-based programming framework programs using log files.	 
* [CPMF-EL5](LOs/CPMF-EL5.md):  	Explore optimization topics in the cloud-based programming framework.
