# Cloud Monitoring and Maintenance - CMM
This KA focuses on how the cloud changes the way software applications are developed, run, monitored and managed.


## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [CMM-CL1](LOs/CMM-CL1.md):  	Revise zone, region, or locations of the application based on performance and use case.	 
* [CMM-CL2](LOs/CMM-CL2.md):  	Explain the main argument in favor of continual and consistent monitoring and oversight in cloud-based IT systems.	 
* [CMM-CL3](LOs/CMM-CL3.md):  	Describe the three types of quantitative measurements that play a role in monitoring.	 
* [CMM-CL4](LOs/CMM-CL4.md):  	Discuss the mechanics of monitoring platforms that utilize agents to collect and report back information.	 
* [CMM-CL5](LOs/CMM-CL5.md):  	Describe the mechanics of monitoring platforms that rely upon pre-existing sources of information such as service logs to analyze performance.	 
* [CMM-CL6](LOs/CMM-CL6.md):  	Explain the metrics that are the most beneficial to monitoring.	 
* [CMM-CL7](LOs/CMM-CL7.md):  	Explain how measurements are used to judge performance levels.	 
* [CMM-CL8](LOs/CMM-CL8.md):  	Describe the justification for problem ticketing.	 
* [CMM-CL9](LOs/CMM-CL9.md):  	Describe what KPIs are and how they differ from metrics.	 
* [CMM-CL10](LOs/CMM-CL10.md):  	Discuss the concept of “everyday remediation.”	 
* [CMM-CL11](LOs/CMM-CL11.md):  	Describe the benefits and purpose of utilisation of infrastructure as code.	 
* [CMM-CL12](LOs/CMM-CL12.md):  	Define the common practices for Monitoring and Managing Cloud Application and Environments.	 
* [CMM-CL13](LOs/CMM-CL13.md):  	Determine SLAs,  Service/Application uptime requirements, Metrics thresholds and alerts.	 
* [CMM-CL14](LOs/CMM-CL14.md):  	Define Operational Support considerations and requirements for management of cloud environment.	 

## Experiental Learning Objectives

* [CMM-EL1](LOs/CMM-EL1.md):  	Enroll a monitoring tool to evaluate application performance and resource utilization.	 
* [CMM-EL2](LOs/CMM-EL2.md):  	Establish automated rules to scale the application based on performance and utilization.	 
* [CMM-EL3](LOs/CMM-EL3.md):  	Demonstrate monitoring best practices within the Cloud Environment (applications and services).	 
* [CMM-EL4](LOs/CMM-EL4.md):  	Demonstrate management techniques and configuration practices withing the Cloud Environment (Console, CLI, SDK/API).	 
* [CMM-EL5](LOs/CMM-EL5.md):  	Configuration of operational metrics and alerts within the Cloud Environment (Monitoring metrics, features. auditing).	 
* [CMM-EL6](LOs/CMM-EL6.md):  	Demonstrate strategies for operational management, including data collection, notifications, best practices recommendations.
