# Cloud Orchestration - CO

This area covers how the cloud impacts deployment methods and
frameworks, for how software applications are developed and deployed. 
This includes the ability for students to build any application, on 
any cloud, using popular application frameworks, and CICD
pipeline and monitoring. Students should be able to demonstrate
an understanding in the automation of workflow processes and
the creation, monitoring and deployment of resources supporting
the applications. Examples of specific techniques and tools in this
area are: Software Delivery, DevOps, CICD, and platform-agnostic
’Infrastructure-as-code’.

Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.

## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [CO-CL1](LOs/CO-CL1.md):  	Recognize and discuss the concepts responsible for the emergence of DevOps.	 
* [CO-CL2](LOs/CO-CL2.md):  	Critique the business benefits of DevOps and continuous delivery.	 
* [CO-CL3](LOs/CO-CL3.md):  	Appraise continuous Integration Fundamentals.	 
* [CO-CL4](LOs/CO-CL4.md):  	Describe the Service Delivery process.	 
* [CO-CL5](LOs/CO-CL5.md):  	Recognize the concepts of test automation, infrastructure automation, and build and deployment automation. 	 
* [CO-CL6](LOs/CO-CL6.md):  	Describe how DevOps relates to Lean and Agile methodologies.	 
* [CO-CL7](LOs/CO-CL7.md):  	Summarize case studies of IT organizations that are making the transformation to Adaptive IT and DevOps models.	 
* [CO-CL8](LOs/CO-CL8.md):  	Critique the capabilities of some of the common and popular DevOps tools.	 
* [CO-CL9](LOs/CO-CL9.md):  	Critique DevOps in relation to IT Service Management (ITSM).	 
* [CO-CL10](LOs/CO-CL10.md):  	Critique automating testing practices and processes.	 
* [CO-CL11](LOs/CO-CL11.md):  	Explain the concept of Infrastructure-as-Code and enumerate the advantages that it offers over ordinary scripting.	 
* [CO-CL12](LOs/CO-CL12.md):  	List some of the tools that implement IaC for popular cloud platforms and describe some of the differences between them.	 
* [CO-CL13](LOs/CO-CL13.md):  	Discuss Terraform’s role as an infrastructure orchestrator and describe how it differs from a conventional configuration manager.	 
* [CO-CL14](LOs/CO-CL14.md):  	Identify the advantages and disadvantages of automating cloud deployments by scripting commands.	 

## Experiental Learning Objectives

* [CO-EL1](LOs/CO-EL1.md):  	Demonstrate configuring, managing and distributing jobs. 	 
* [CO-EL2](LOs/CO-EL2.md):  	Demonstrate using build automation tools. Demonstrate implementing automated and continuous deployment. 

* [CO-EL3](LOs/CO-EL3.md):  	Demonstrate Infrastructure Setup and DevOps Installation of CICD, version control, and orchestration tools. 	 
* [CO-EL4](LOs/CO-EL4.md):  	Create a Cloud Integration and Cloud Development (CICD) "pipeline" process for maintenance upgrades, patches and changes to the application.	 
* [CO-EL5](LOs/CO-EL5.md):  	Deploy a software application as a cloud service.
