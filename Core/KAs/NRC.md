# Networking Resources on the Cloud (NRC)
In this KA, students will gain an overview of general cloud-related
concepts for networking. Students will define and then utilize virtual networks in the cloud networking paradigm. Students will
design network models, and then deploy a developed virtual and
software-defined network (SDN) as part of utilizing cloud resources.
Students will identify how elasticity, federation, and interoperability play a role in networking resources on the cloud. Students will
also identify security concerns related to cloud networking and
access management in the cloud computing paradigm.

Each of the following Learning Objectives links to a list of materials that can be used to teach the LO.

## Conceptual Learning Objectives

* [NRC-CL1](LOs/NRC-CL1.md):  	Discuss cloud networking as part of cloud utilization.	 
* [NRC-CL2](LOs/NRC-CL2.md):  	Critique connectivity, and application interactions with the network and novel techniques in each of these areas that are pushing cloud computing capabilities farther.	 
* [NRC-CL3](LOs/NRC-CL3.md):  	Define virtual networks as part of provisioning cloud resources on the cloud.	 
* [NRC-CL4](LOs/NRC-CL4.md):  	Explain congestion control, to include TCP congestion control and how it impacts data flow in data centers.	 
* [NRC-CL5](LOs/NRC-CL5.md):  	Evaluate physical network structures, considering how the increasing demand for bandwidth within data centers influences the network design.	 
* [NRC-CL6](LOs/NRC-CL6.md):  	Discuss and explain the use of SDNs as part of cloud implementation to address virtual networking requirements and challenges.	 
* [NRC-CL7](LOs/NRC-CL7.md):  	Identify elasticity, federation and interoperability in cloud utilization.	 
* [NRC-CL8](LOs/NRC-CL8.md):  	Explain the importance of interoperability in utilizing multiple cloud networking resources.	 
* [NRC-CL9](LOs/NRC-CL9.md):  	Identify security issues and apply learned threat mitigation techniques at the multiple layers of the network.	 
* [NRC-CL9](LOs/NRC-CL9.md):  	Discuss how to build virtual private clouds.	 

## Experiental Learning Objectives
